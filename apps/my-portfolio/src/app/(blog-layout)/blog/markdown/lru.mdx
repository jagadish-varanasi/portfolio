## **LRU Cache Problem**

#### **Overview**

The Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is a data structure that stores a limited number of items and evicts the least recently used item when the cache reaches its capacity. This is useful in scenarios where you want to keep a limited amount of data readily accessible and discard the least important data when necessary.

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Cache Capacity**: The maximum number of items the cache can hold.
2. **Cache Hit**: When the requested data is found in the cache.
3. **Cache Miss**: When the requested data is not found in the cache.
4. **Eviction Policy**: The strategy used to remove items from the cache when it is full. For LRU, the least recently used item is removed.

#### **Operations**

1. **Get(key)**: Retrieve the value associated with the key if it exists in the cache; otherwise, return -1.
2. **Put(key, value)**: Insert or update the value associated with the key. If the cache is full, evict the least recently used item before inserting the new item.

#### **Data Structures**

To efficiently implement an LRU cache, you typically use:

1. **HashMap (or Dictionary)**: For O(1) average time complexity for get and put operations.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: To keep track of the order of usage. The most recently used items are moved to the front, and the least recently used items are moved to the back.

### **Conceptual Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Create a HashMap to store key-value pairs.
   - Create a Doubly Linked List to maintain the order of usage.

2. **Get Operation**:

   - Check if the key exists in the HashMap.
   - If it exists, move the corresponding node to the front of the Doubly Linked List (indicating recent use).
   - Return the value.
   - If it does not exist, return -1.

3. **Put Operation**:

   - Check if the key already exists in the HashMap.
   - If it exists, update the value and move the corresponding node to the front of the Doubly Linked List.
   - If it does not exist, check if the cache is at capacity.
   - If at capacity, remove the node at the back of the Doubly Linked List (least recently used) and delete its entry from the HashMap.
   - Insert the new key-value pair into the HashMap and add a new node to the front of the Doubly Linked List.


### **Example Scenario**

Let's say we have a cache with a capacity of 2:

1. **Put(1, 1)**: Cache is (1=1)
2. **Put(2, 2)**: Cache is (1=1, 2=2)
3. **Get(1)**: Returns 1, Cache is (2=2, 1=1) (1 is now most recently used)
4. **Put(3, 3)**: Cache is full, evicts key 2, Cache is (1=1, 3=3)
5. **Get(2)**: Returns -1 (not found)
6. **Put(4, 4)**: Cache is full, evicts key 1, Cache is (3=3, 4=4)
7. **Get(1)**: Returns -1 (not found)
8. **Get(3)**: Returns 3, Cache is (4=4, 3=3) (3 is now most recently used)
9. **Get(4)**: Returns 4, Cache is (3=3, 4=4) (4 is now most recently used)


### **Key Components for LRU Cache Implementation**

1. **Doubly Linked List**:

   - Each node contains a key, value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - The head of the list represents the most recently used item, and the tail represents the least recently used item.

2. **HashMap**:

   - Stores key-node pairs for O(1) access to nodes.

### **Conceptual Steps**

1. **Node Class**:

   - Represents each entry in the doubly linked list.

2. **Doubly Linked List Class**:

   - Methods to add, remove, and move nodes to the front.

3. **LRU Cache Class**:

   - Methods for `get` and `put` operations.
   - Maintains the doubly linked list and hashmap.

### **Example Pseudocode**

##### **Node Class**

```js
class Node {
    constructor(key, value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
```

##### **Doubly Linked List Class**

```js
class DoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
    }

    addNode(node) {
        // Add node to the front (head) of the list
    }

    removeNode(node) {
        // Remove node from the list
    }

    moveToHead(node) {
        // Move existing node to the front (head) of the list
    }

    removeTail() {
        // Remove the tail node and return it
    }
}
```

##### **LRU Cache Class**

```js
class LRUCache {
    constructor(capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.cache = new Map();
        this.dll = new DoublyLinkedList();
    }

    get(key) {
        // Retrieve value from cache if exists, move node to head
    }

    put(key, value) {
        // Insert or update value in cache, handle capacity
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

- **Node Class**: Represents each cache entry.
- **Doubly Linked List Class**: Manages the order of cache entries.
- **LRU Cache Class**: Integrates the doubly linked list and hashmap to provide efficient cache operations.

By combining these data structures, the LRU cache can achieve the desired performance characteristics.
